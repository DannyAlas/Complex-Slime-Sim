# Complex-Slime-Sim

## A slight modification of Sebastion Lagues code for Unity
In this simulation, there are many particles, each of which leaves a trail behind itself as it moves. These trails diffuse over time and each particle also has between 1 and 10 circular sensors arranged in an arc in front of them. These sensors are used to detect the intensity of nearby trails, and the particle turns towards whichever is the highest intensity. Some randomness is added to the turning as well.

The idea for this comes from this paper: https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/980579
